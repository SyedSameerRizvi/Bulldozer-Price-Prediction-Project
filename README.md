# Bulldozer Prize Prediction

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project to predict the sale price of bulldozers. The project uses historical auction data and other relevant features to train machine learning models that predict the final auction sale prices of bulldozers.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the auction prices of bulldozers, given a dataset from a Kaggle competition hosted by Blue Book for Bulldozers. The dataset contains various features about the bulldozers and the auctions, including usage metrics, auction dates, and equipment type.

This project is divided into the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating new features that could help improve model performance.
3. Modeling: Training different machine learning models to predict the bulldozer prices.
4. Evaluation: Comparing the models based on their performance metrics.
5. Prediction: Making final price predictions based on the trained model.

The data used in this project comes from the Kaggle competition Blue Book for Bulldozers. You can find the dataset here.

The dataset includes several key features, such as:

SalesID: Unique identifier for the sale.
MachineID: Unique identifier for the machine.
ModelID: Identifier for the specific model of the bulldozer.
Usage metrics: Various features like YearMade, AuctioneerID, and MachineHoursCurrentMeter.
To use the dataset for this project, you'll need to download it from Kaggle and follow the instructions in the notebook to load and preprocess it.

## Dataset
The data used in this project comes from the Kaggle competition Blue Book for Bulldozers. You can find the dataset here.

The dataset includes several key features, such as:

* SalesID: Unique identifier for the sale.
* MachineID: Unique identifier for the machine.
* ModelID: Identifier for the specific model of the bulldozer.
* Usage metrics: Various features like YearMade, AuctioneerID, and MachineHoursCurrentMeter.
To use the dataset for this project, you'll need to download it from Kaggle and follow the instructions in the notebook to load and preprocess it.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need to install the following Python libraries:
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `jupyter`

You can install the required libraries by running:

     ```pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

    ```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bulldozer-price-prediction.git```

2. Download the dataset from Kaggle (linked above) and place it in the appropriate folder as outlined in the notebook.
3. Open the notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions to run the project.
4. Run the notebook:

    ```jupyter notebook end-to-end-bulldozer-price-prediction.ipynb```

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the models, and make predictions.

## Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on the `Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)`. This evaluation metric is commonly used for regression problems where the target variable (sale price) can span several orders of magnitude.

## Results
After training and evaluating several models, the model with the best performance was chosen for final predictions. Details of the model performance, along with visualizations of the predicted vs. actual prices, can be found in the notebook.

## Conclusions
This project provides a comprehensive workflow for predicting bulldozer prices using machine learning techniques.
